## PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Customer Support Manager of a fictional call center with locations in Baltimore, Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles has raised concerns about the current average Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score across all centers. The stakeholder has approached the data team to investigate the underlying factors contributing to the subpar CSAT performance. The objective is to uncover actionable insights that can help improve the CSAT score to above-average levels.
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project was initiated in response to concerns raised by the Customer Support Manager regarding the average Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores reported across all call centers. The stakeholderâ€™s goal was to understand the factors influencing these scores and identify strategies to improve performance above current averages.

To address this, a comprehensive analysis was conducted using call center performance data, including metrics such as call duration, customer sentiment, response times, and call volume. The objective was to uncover patterns, correlations, and root causes that may be impacting customer satisfaction.

Key findings from the analysis highlighted specific operational challenges contributing to lower CSAT scores, such as prolonged call/resolution times and inconsistent service quality among agents. Based on these insights, targeted recommendations were developed ranging from agent training programs and process optimization to resource alloacations and re-directing.The outcomes of this project are intended to support data-driven decision-making and empower the stakeholder to implement effective changes that will elevate CSAT scores across all call centers.

## The dashboard answers the following business questions and more 

1. **Customer satisfaction and expreince**
   * How satisfied are customers with their interaction?
   * Which factors contribute to dissatisfaction?
     
2. **Call center Perfomance**
   * How many calls are being handled by each call center?
   * What is the average responce time and are SLA's met?
   * What is the average call duration and is it dependent on location or issue at hand?

3. **Call reasons and issue resolution**
   * What are the most common reasons customers contact the call centers?
   * How does the call reason impact customer sentiment or resolution time?

## I took the following steps to create the dashboard
1. Imported the raw data into Ms Excel.
2. Cleaned and Normalised the Data in Excel.
3. Created Pivot Tables to Analyse the data.
4. Imported the Excel file into Power BI.
5. Created Visualisations on Power BI from all the insights found using pivot tables in Excel.
6. Published everything on Github.
   
## Dashboard Breakdown
  * The dashboard is fully interactable
  * The Filters are dependent on each other and change according to selection

## key insights
1. LA is the most popular call centre receiving the most amount of calls whilst Denver is the least popular with the least amount of calls.
2. Most calls (63%) fall within SLA standards and 25% exceed acceptable SLA thresholds.
3. LA shows the highest positive sentiments but also the highest negative sentiments.
4. customers prefer self service options (80%) as opposed to direct call centre interactions (20%)
5. Majority of the calls are about billing questions

## Recommendations
1. Optimise resource allocation by re-directing agents and resources from least popular call centres to popular centres
2. To improve on SLA further periodic training to agents can be implemented based on prominent call reasons
3. Invest in improvements to the self service options and gather feedback from users to keep on improving the efficiency given the popularity of self service options
4. Simplify billing systems and provide more communication in regards to any changes or updates to systems.
