# POWER BI | CALL CENTRE DASHBOARD

## PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Customer Support Manager of a fictional call center with locations in Baltimore, Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles has raised concerns about the current average Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score across all centers. The stakeholder has approached the data team to investigate the underlying factors contributing to the subpar CSAT performance. The objective is to uncover actionable insights that can help improve the CSAT score to above-average levels.
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project was initiated in response to concerns raised by the Customer Support Manager regarding the average Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores reported across all call centers. The stakeholderâ€™s goal was to understand the factors influencing these scores and identify strategies to improve performance above current averages.

To address this, a comprehensive analysis was conducted using call center performance data, including metrics such as call duration, customer sentiment, response times, and call volume. The objective was to uncover patterns, correlations, and root causes that may be impacting customer satisfaction.

Key findings from the analysis highlighted specific operational challenges contributing to lower CSAT scores, such as prolonged call/resolution times and inconsistent service quality among agents. Based on these insights, targeted recommendations were developed ranging from agent training programs and process optimization to resource alloacations and re-directing.The outcomes of this project are intended to support data-driven decision-making and empower the stakeholder to implement effective changes that will elevate CSAT scores across all call centers.

## KEY INSIGHTS

**INSIGHTS**
* Los Angeles and Baltimore call centres are the most popular receiving a combined 75% of the total calls from all the call centres.
* over 60% of the calls are based on billing questions and most of the customers prefer to use self service methods such as chatbot, Email and Web serices and this could be contributed by the prolonged resolution times experinced by customers averaging at 25 min per call.
   
**RECOMMENDATIONS**
1. Optimise resource allocation by re-directing agents and resources from least popular call centres to popular centres
2. To improve on resolution times further periodic training to agents can be implemented based on prominent call reasons.
3. Since most people prefer self service options investing in improvements to the self service options and gathering feedback from users to keep on improving the efficiency.
4. Since currently most of the question are about billing simplifying the billing systems and providing more communication in regards to any changes or updates to systems should be key.
