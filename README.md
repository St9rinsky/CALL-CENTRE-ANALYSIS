## SUMMARY
This Dashboard provides summary of inbound calls from from four major call centers in the United states, Data with over 30 000 records was cleaned and analysed using Ms excel and pivot tables and finally the data insights visualised over on Power Bi

## The dashboard answers the following business questions and more 

1. **Customer satisfaction and expreince**
   * How satisfied are customers with their interaction?
   * Which factors contribute to dissatisfaction?
     
2. **Call center Perfomance**
   * How many calls are being handled by each call center?
   * What is the average responce time and are SLA's met?
   * What is the average call duration and is it dependent on location or issue at hand?

3. **Call reasons and issue resolution**
   * What are the most common reasons customers contact the call centers?
   * How does the call reason impact customer sentiment or resolution time?

## I took the following steps to create the dashboard
1. Imported the raw data into Ms Excel.
2. Cleaned and Normalised the Data in Excel.
3. Created Pivot Tables to Analyse the data.
4. Imported the Excel file into Power BI.
5. Created Visualisations on Power BI from all the insights found using pivot tables in Excel.
6. Published everything on Github.
   
## Dashboard Breakdown
  * The dashboard is fully interactable
  * The Filters are dependent on each other and change according to selection

## key insights
1. LA is the most popular call centre receiving the most amount of calls whilst Denver is the least popular with the least amount of calls.
2. Most calls (63%) fall within SLA standards and 25% exceed acceptable SLA thresholds.
3. LA shows the highest positive sentiments but also the highest negative sentiments.
4. customers prefer self service options (80%) as opposed to direct call centre interactions (20%)
5. Majority of the calls are about billing questions

## Recommendations
1. Optimise resource allocation by re-directing agents and resources from least popular call centres to popular centres
2. To improve on SLA further periodic training to agents can be implemented based on prominent call reasons
3. Invest in improvements to the self service options and gather feedback from users to keep on improving the efficiency given the popularity of self service options
4. Simplify billing systems and provide more communication in regards to any changes or updates to systems.
